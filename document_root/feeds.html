Perhaps the greatest benefits of technology are from modern medicine, which has improved our health and lengthened our lives. However, technology has a

             <p> The brain can get so facinating that every thought and movement that we make is controlled by the brain. The brain is more complex than any computer ever invented. It enables us to think, speak, hear, see, feel, and move.<br></p><br>

              <p>It works nonstop day and night. The brain consist of billions of living cells called neurons or nerve cells. Neurons carry millions of messages to the brain along the spinal chord, which runs down the back and 
                  links the brain with the rest of the body. When these messages or nerve signals reach the brain,it sorts them out and sends instructions to the rest of the body along the nerves. Nerves are like wires made of bundles of nervecells. Sensory nerves takes signals from te eyes, ears, and skin to te brain; motor nerves
                  takes signals from the brain to the muscles, telling them when to move the body.The average adult human brain weighs about 1.4kg(3lb) and as a texture like jelly. it is protected inside the head by the skull.
